Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

## bind mounts
https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/
When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file or directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine.
The file or directory does not need to exist on the Docker host already.
